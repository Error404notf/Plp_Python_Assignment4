# Certainly! Let's break this down step by step.

# 1. Create the Person Class
# First, we'll define the Person class with the specified attributes and the introduce method.
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.gender = gender
    
    def introduce(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old and my gender is {self.gender}.")

# 2. Create an Instance and Call the introduce Method

# Create an instance of the Person class
person = Person("Alice", 30, "Female")

# Call the introduce method
person.introduce()
